        <p>When most people hear "tech job," they imagine someone glued to a screen, typing endless lines of code. But the truth? Tech is way more diverse — and creative — than you might think. Whether you're analytical, artistic, strategic, or somewhere in between, there's a role for you. And spoiler alert: women are already killing it in these spaces.</p>
    
          <p>Here are five tech careers you <strong>might not have heard of</strong> — but that you could totally thrive in:</p>
    
          <h2>💡 UX Designer (User Experience Designer)</h2>
          <p>If you’re the kind of person who notices when an app feels clunky or a website just <em>works</em>, UX design might be your thing. UX designers make digital experiences smooth, intuitive, and user-friendly. It’s where psychology, creativity, and empathy meet design. And the best part? You don’t need to code — just an eye for what feels right.</p>
    
          <h2>🔐 Cybersecurity Analyst</h2>
          <p>Love solving puzzles or spotting when something feels off? Cybersecurity is about protecting data and systems from hackers and cyber threats. With digital safety becoming more important than ever, cybersecurity analysts are in high demand — and women are underrepresented. That means: massive opportunity.</p>
    
          <h2>🧠 Data Ethics Specialist</h2>
          <p>As tech gets smarter (think AI and big data), we need people who can ask, "Is this the right thing to do?" Data ethics specialists work at the intersection of tech, law, and morality. If you care about fairness, privacy, and accountability, this is a growing space where your voice matters.</p>
    
          <h2>🤖 AI Prompt Engineer</h2>
          <p>This one's new — and super cool. Prompt engineers write clever instructions for AI tools like ChatGPT to get the best results. It's part communication, part creativity, part logic. No coding required, just clear thinking and a playful approach to language and problem-solving.</p>
    
          <h2>📈 Product Manager</h2>
          <p>Think of this as the CEO of a product. Product managers work with designers, developers, and marketers to turn an idea into something real. If you're organised, love bringing people together, and enjoy solving problems from a big-picture view, this is your jam.</p>
    
          <p>So whether you’re tech-curious, mid-career, or just exploring — don’t let the word “tech” scare you. There’s room for storytellers, organisers, artists, thinkers, and dreamers.</p>

            <h2>🔍 Before You Go: Prep Like a Pro</h2>
            <p>Think of this as your mission briefing. Start by researching the event. Check out the speakers, scan the attendee list (if available), and look up the companies or topics being covered. This prep will help you feel grounded and give you conversation starters.</p>
    
            <p>Now, the magic move: create your elevator pitch. Just 20–30 seconds of who you are, what you’re into, and what you’re hoping to gain. Keep it natural, and practice until it flows confidently — not like a robot.</p>
    
            <p>Pro tip: pack business cards (yes, even basic ones), a notebook, and a pen. Dress smart-casual or whatever makes you feel like your most powerful self. Confidence is half the battle.</p>
    
            <h2>🌟 At the Event: Dive In</h2>
            <p>Take a breath. You belong here. Everyone started somewhere. Begin with low-pressure conversations — someone standing solo, or a small, relaxed group. Smile, introduce yourself, and ask open-ended questions like: “What brought you here today?” or “What’s been your favourite part of the event so far?”</p>
    
            <p>Listen like you mean it. Don’t just wait to speak — really engage. People appreciate feeling heard, and it makes you way more memorable.</p>
    
            <p>It’s totally okay to ask for advice! Try: “I’m new to the industry and curious about [topic] — do you have any tips for someone just starting out?” Most people love to share wisdom — and it sparks meaningful conversation.</p>
    
            <h2>📩 After the Event: Keep the Spark Alive</h2>
            <p>Networking doesn’t stop at the venue doors. Follow up within a couple of days. Send a thoughtful LinkedIn request or a quick email referencing your chat. It shows you were paying attention — and keeps the door open.</p>
    
            <p>Want to learn more from someone you clicked with? Ask for a virtual coffee. A 15-minute chat can lead to mentorship, internships, or even your next big break.</p>
    
            <h2>💬 Final Word: You’ve Got This</h2>
            <p>Tech is full of amazing, welcoming people. Show up as yourself — enthusiastic, curious, and ready to grow. Your perspective matters, and your fresh energy is an asset. </p>
    
            <p>Networking isn’t about collecting contacts. It’s about building real, human connections. So go ahead: step into that room, start that conversation, and <strong>own your space</strong> in tech.</p>

     "summary": "You belong here. Learn how to recognise imposter syndrome, shift your mindset, and own your space in the tech world.",
     "image": "images/imposter.jpg", "body": """
         <p>Have you ever felt like you don't belong in tech? That despite your accomplishments, you’re just one mistake away from being exposed as a fraud? If so, you’re not alone. This feeling is called imposter syndrome, and it affects countless professionals in the tech industry—including some of the most successful developers, engineers, and leaders.</p>
        
        <h2>What is Imposter Syndrome?</h2>
        <p>Imposter syndrome is the persistent belief that your success is due to luck or external factors rather than your skills and effort. It can manifest as self-doubt, fear of failure, or even perfectionism that prevents you from acknowledging your achievements.</p>
        
        <h2>Recognizing the Signs</h2>
        <p>Imposter syndrome can look different for everyone, but common signs include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Feeling like a fraud despite evidence of competence</li>
            <li>Downplaying achievements or attributing them to luck</li>
            <li>Fear of being “found out” as underqualified</li>
            <li>Comparing yourself to others and feeling inadequate</li>
            <li>Overworking to compensate for perceived shortcomings</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>How to Overcome Imposter Syndrome</h2>
        <p>While imposter syndrome can be challenging, there are ways to shift your mindset and reclaim your confidence.</p>
        
        <h3>1. Reframe Your Thoughts</h3>
        <p>Instead of thinking, “I don’t belong here,” remind yourself, “I am constantly learning and growing.” Recognizing that everyone experiences doubt at some point can help normalize your feelings.</p>
        
        <h3>2. Keep a Record of Your Achievements</h3>
        <p>Maintain a “wins” journal where you document successes, positive feedback, and milestones. Reviewing your progress can serve as a powerful reminder of your abilities.</p>
        
        <h3>3. Talk About It</h3>
        <p>Share your feelings with trusted colleagues, mentors, or support groups. You’ll likely find that many others have faced similar struggles and can offer guidance or reassurance.</p>
        
        <h3>4. Stop Comparing Yourself to Others</h3>
        <p>Social media and professional networks can make it easy to compare yourself to high achievers. Remember, what you see is often a highlight reel, not the full story. Focus on your own growth and journey.</p>
        
        <h3>5. Accept That Perfection is a Myth</h3>
        <p>No one knows everything, and making mistakes is part of learning. Embrace challenges as opportunities to improve rather than as proof of incompetence.</p>
        
        <h2>You Belong Here</h2>
        <p>The tech industry needs diverse voices and perspectives—yours included. Recognizing and overcoming imposter syndrome takes time, but every step you take strengthens your confidence and resilience. So own your space, trust your abilities, and keep moving forward. You’ve earned your place in tech.</p>

     "summary": "A mentor can change your tech journey. Discover the benefits of mentorship and practical ways to connect with inspiring women in tech.",
     "image": "images/mentorship.jpg", "body": """
     <p>In the ever-evolving world of technology, women continue to break barriers, innovate, and inspire. Yet, the path can often feel lonely, competitive, and overwhelming—especially when you're just starting out. This is where having a mentor becomes not just helpful, but transformative. A mentor is more than a guide—they're a sounding board, a motivator, and sometimes, your biggest cheerleader. For every girl navigating the tech space, mentorship can make all the difference.</p>
        
        <h2>The Power of Mentorship</h2>
        
        <p>Let’s face it—tech can be intimidating. Whether you're learning to code, trying to land your first role, or exploring new specialisations like AI or cybersecurity, the learning curve can be steep. A mentor helps you navigate that journey by sharing insights, pointing out blind spots, and encouraging you through the hard days. They’ve likely faced similar struggles and can offer the kind of real-world advice you won’t find in a textbook or online course.</p>
        
        <p>Mentors also help boost your confidence. Imposter syndrome is a real and common experience in tech, especially for women in male-dominated teams. Knowing someone believes in your potential and has walked the path before you can be incredibly empowering. It reminds you that you do belong—and that your voice and ideas matter.</p>
        
        <h2>Opportunities, Networks, and Growth</h2>
        
        <p>Beyond personal support, mentors can open doors. They can introduce you to opportunities you might not have known about, help you refine your goals, and even connect you with other women in tech. A mentor’s network is a valuable resource, especially when you’re trying to grow professionally or pivot your career.</p>
        
        <p>Mentorship can also accelerate your learning. Instead of trial and error, you benefit from someone else's experience. Whether it's guidance on building a standout portfolio, negotiating your salary, or overcoming workplace challenges, having that perspective can save time and build resilience.</p>
        
        <h2>How to Find a Mentor</h2>
        
        <p>The good news? You don’t need to wait for the perfect mentor to magically appear. You can take action today. Start by identifying what kind of support you’re looking for. Are you seeking help breaking into tech? Clarity about your career path? Advice on managing work-life balance in a demanding role?</p>
        
        <p>Next, start networking with intention. Join tech communities for women, like <strong>Women Who Code</strong>, <strong>Girls in Tech</strong>, or <strong>Tech Ladies</strong>. Attend local meetups, online webinars, and conferences. Don’t be afraid to reach out to someone you admire on LinkedIn or Twitter with a thoughtful message. Most women in tech remember what it was like starting out—and are happy to support the next generation.</p>
        
        <p>Also, look for structured mentorship programmes. Many companies and organisations offer formal mentorship initiatives where you’ll be matched with experienced professionals who want to give back.</p>
        
        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        
        <p>Mentorship is a game changer. It’s the difference between figuring things out alone and having someone by your side who believes in you. So don’t hesitate—seek out that connection. Every girl in tech deserves someone in her corner.</p>"""},

     <p>Ah, the salary question — the moment that can make even the most confident tech newbie sweat. “What are your salary expectations?” or worse, “What are you currently making?” Cue the internal panic. But guess what? You’ve got this.</p>
    
            <h2>📊 Know Your Worth</h2>
            <p>Before you walk into any interview, come armed with knowledge. Use tools like Glassdoor, Payscale, and LinkedIn Salary to get a sense of the going rate for your role, experience level, and location. Your number isn’t random — it’s a reflection of your value. Research is power.</p>
    
            <h2>🚫 Skip the Salary History Trap</h2>
            <p>In many places, it’s illegal to ask about your past pay — and even where it’s legal, you don’t have to answer. Try this: <strong>“I’m focused on the value I bring to this role and prefer to discuss salary based on the market rate.”</strong> Professional, clear, and puts the focus where it belongs: forward.</p>
    
            <h2>💬 Talk Ranges, Not Exact Numbers</h2>
            <p>Instead of locking yourself into a single figure, offer a well-researched range. For example: <strong>“Based on my research, I’m looking for something in the range of 60 to 70k, depending on the full package.”</strong> Flexibility shows confidence and leaves room for negotiation.</p>
    
            <h2>🌟 Lead with Value</h2>
            <p>Don’t just talk about what you want — talk about what you bring. Highlight your skills, enthusiasm, and what you’ll contribute. <em>“With my background in UX and project coordination, I’m confident I can make an immediate impact on your product team.”</em></p>
    
            <h2>🧾 Look at the Full Picture</h2>
            <p>Salary is just one slice of the pie. Think about health benefits, remote work, learning stipends, mental health days, and career growth opportunities. These all add serious value to your total package.</p>
    
            <h2>🗣️ Practice Makes Powerful</h2>
            <p>Negotiation is a skill, and like any skill — you get better with practice. Do a mock run with a friend, mentor, or even in the mirror. The more you say it out loud, the more confident you’ll feel.</p>
    
            <h2>⏳ Take Your Time</h2>
            <p>If you’re offered something that feels off, it’s okay to ask for time. Say, <em>“Thank you — I’d love to take a day or two to consider the offer.”</em> Professional. Assertive. Respectful.</p>
    
            <p>💪 As a new girl in tech, your ideas, skills, and voice matter. Don’t be afraid to advocate for yourself. The right role will honour your worth — and you’re more than worth it.</p>
