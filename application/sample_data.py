        <p>When most people hear "tech job," they imagine someone glued to a screen, typing endless lines of code. But the truth? Tech is way more diverse — and creative — than you might think. Whether you're analytical, artistic, strategic, or somewhere in between, there's a role for you. And spoiler alert: women are already killing it in these spaces.</p>
    
          <p>Here are five tech careers you <strong>might not have heard of</strong> — but that you could totally thrive in:</p>
    
          <h2>💡 UX Designer (User Experience Designer)</h2>
          <p>If you’re the kind of person who notices when an app feels clunky or a website just <em>works</em>, UX design might be your thing. UX designers make digital experiences smooth, intuitive, and user-friendly. It’s where psychology, creativity, and empathy meet design. And the best part? You don’t need to code — just an eye for what feels right.</p>
    
          <h2>🔐 Cybersecurity Analyst</h2>
          <p>Love solving puzzles or spotting when something feels off? Cybersecurity is about protecting data and systems from hackers and cyber threats. With digital safety becoming more important than ever, cybersecurity analysts are in high demand — and women are underrepresented. That means: massive opportunity.</p>
    
          <h2>🧠 Data Ethics Specialist</h2>
          <p>As tech gets smarter (think AI and big data), we need people who can ask, "Is this the right thing to do?" Data ethics specialists work at the intersection of tech, law, and morality. If you care about fairness, privacy, and accountability, this is a growing space where your voice matters.</p>
    
          <h2>🤖 AI Prompt Engineer</h2>
          <p>This one's new — and super cool. Prompt engineers write clever instructions for AI tools like ChatGPT to get the best results. It's part communication, part creativity, part logic. No coding required, just clear thinking and a playful approach to language and problem-solving.</p>
    
          <h2>📈 Product Manager</h2>
          <p>Think of this as the CEO of a product. Product managers work with designers, developers, and marketers to turn an idea into something real. If you're organised, love bringing people together, and enjoy solving problems from a big-picture view, this is your jam.</p>
    
          <p>So whether you’re tech-curious, mid-career, or just exploring — don’t let the word “tech” scare you. There’s room for storytellers, organisers, artists, thinkers, and dreamers.</p>
    
          <p><strong>The future of tech is diverse — and we want you in it.</strong></p>

        <p>You’re new to tech. You’ve got your first networking event coming up. And if we’re being real? The idea of entering a room full of confident, experienced professionals is… intimidating. But don’t panic — this is your chance to shine, learn, and start building your tribe in tech!</p>
    
            <h2>🔍 Before You Go: Prep Like a Pro</h2>
            <p>Think of this as your mission briefing. Start by researching the event. Check out the speakers, scan the attendee list (if available), and look up the companies or topics being covered. This prep will help you feel grounded and give you conversation starters.</p>
    
            <p>Now, the magic move: create your elevator pitch. Just 20–30 seconds of who you are, what you’re into, and what you’re hoping to gain. Keep it natural, and practice until it flows confidently — not like a robot.</p>
    
            <p>Pro tip: pack business cards (yes, even basic ones), a notebook, and a pen. Dress smart-casual or whatever makes you feel like your most powerful self. Confidence is half the battle.</p>
    
            <h2>🌟 At the Event: Dive In</h2>
            <p>Take a breath. You belong here. Everyone started somewhere. Begin with low-pressure conversations — someone standing solo, or a small, relaxed group. Smile, introduce yourself, and ask open-ended questions like: “What brought you here today?” or “What’s been your favourite part of the event so far?”</p>
    
            <p>Listen like you mean it. Don’t just wait to speak — really engage. People appreciate feeling heard, and it makes you way more memorable.</p>
    
            <p>It’s totally okay to ask for advice! Try: “I’m new to the industry and curious about [topic] — do you have any tips for someone just starting out?” Most people love to share wisdom — and it sparks meaningful conversation.</p>
    
            <h2>📩 After the Event: Keep the Spark Alive</h2>
            <p>Networking doesn’t stop at the venue doors. Follow up within a couple of days. Send a thoughtful LinkedIn request or a quick email referencing your chat. It shows you were paying attention — and keeps the door open.</p>
    
            <p>Want to learn more from someone you clicked with? Ask for a virtual coffee. A 15-minute chat can lead to mentorship, internships, or even your next big break.</p>
    
            <h2>💬 Final Word: You’ve Got This</h2>
            <p>Tech is full of amazing, welcoming people. Show up as yourself — enthusiastic, curious, and ready to grow. Your perspective matters, and your fresh energy is an asset. </p>
    
            <p>Networking isn’t about collecting contacts. It’s about building real, human connections. So go ahead: step into that room, start that conversation, and <strong>own your space</strong> in tech.</p>
